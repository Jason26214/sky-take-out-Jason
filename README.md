# Project Name: SKY TAKEOUT

## Sky Takeout Project Overview

This project (Sky Takeout) is a custom software product designed specifically for catering enterprises (restaurants,
caf√©s). It includes two parts: a backend system management platform and a mini-program application. The backend system
is mainly provided for internal use by catering enterprises, allowing for the management and maintenance of restaurant
categories, dishes, combos, orders, employees, and other aspects. It also provides statistical functions for various
restaurant data and supports live order broadcasting. The mini-program is primarily intended for consumer use, allowing
users to browse dishes online, add items to the cart, place orders, make payments, and follow up on orders.
